This repo is for managing the http://sift3d.xyz/ splash page using a combination of Three.JS and the Flow Immersive embedded Data Story Telling platform. 

The Page was provided under an Open Source repo developed by those credited below. Changes should be applied to the /src folder after cloning the project.


## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
# Note: Before committing a new build, Copy the CNAME file into the new builds /docs folder 
npm run build


```

The /docs folder is the output of running `npm run build`
